*Coming soon page for Jekyll*

# Soon

A simple *coming soon* page built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

## What's in it?

A single static page with a full screen image. Remember those *under construction* sites? The point is to have a contact page for a few hours or a few days while you are building your amazing site.

***

## Get started
It's easy, [install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), clone this folder, ```cd soon``` then run ```jekyll serve``` to check how it looks locally (localhost:4000). Self host or use [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) to publish the site.

You just need to change ```_config``` with your contact and site information and ```index.md``` to get the page up and running. Although it is just a starting point and you can change pretty much anything else. If you change the background image, don't forget to link the new image in ```_layouts/default.html```. Background image are located in ```images```.

## Almost ready

Since you wanted to install Jekyll anyway, *Soon* comes with all the usual starting folders to run a complete Jekyll site or blog. This means you can style and test your site in the background. Publish your *Soon* page. Once your are happy with your layouts for posts, pages, collections and anything else in your site assets you can just overwrite everything and push your live site.
